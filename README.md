## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **🔒 Recommended: Private Version (Secure)**

For the best and most secure experience, we **strongly recommend** creating a private copy of this GPT with your API key pre-configured:

1. **Follow our duplication guide**: [GPT Duplication Guide](GPT_DUPLICATION_GUIDE.md)
2. **Create a private copy** of the GPT
3. **Configure your API key** in the private version
4. **Use without setup** - your key is already configured!

**Benefits of Private Version:**
- ✅ **Secure**: Your API key is private and encrypted
- ✅ **No setup required**: Ready to use immediately
- ✅ **Full functionality**: All features available
- ✅ **Personal**: Only you have access

### **🌐 Public Version (Limited)**

The public version is available for testing and demonstration purposes, but requires manual API key setup in each conversation:

1. **Find the LetsCould GPT** in the GPT Store
2. **Start a conversation** with the GPT
3. **Start managing your infrastructure!**

**⚠️ Security Note**: The public version requires you to share your API key in the conversation, which is less secure. We recommend using the private version for production use.

## 🎯 **What You Can Do**

### **Server Operations**
```
"Create a new Ubuntu server"
"Start my server-123"
"Stop all running servers"
"Reboot server-456"
"Delete server-789"
"Show me all my servers"
```

### **SSH Key Management**
```
"Add a new SSH key"
"List my SSH keys"
"Remove SSH key key-123"
```

### **Snapshot Operations**
```
"Create a snapshot of server-123"
"List snapshots for server-456"
"Restore server from snapshot snap-789"
```

### **Account Information**
```
"Show my account balance"
"Get my account information"
"Check my current usage"
```

## 🔧 **Authentication**

### **🔒 Recommended: Private GPT Setup**

For secure and convenient access, create a private copy of this GPT:

1. **Follow our duplication guide**: [GPT Duplication Guide](GPT_DUPLICATION_GUIDE.md)
2. **Configure your API key** in the private GPT settings
3. **Your key is encrypted** and stored securely by OpenAI
4. **No need to share keys** in conversations

### **🌐 Public GPT Setup (Alternative)**

If using the public version, you'll need to provide your API key in each conversation:

**⚠️ Security Warning**: This method is less secure as your API key is shared in the conversation.

### **Getting Your API Token**

1. **Log in** to your [LetsCould Dashboard](https://app.letscloud.io)
2. **Go to Settings** → API Keys
3. **Generate a new API key**
4. **Copy the token** (keep it secure!)

### **Authentication Scheme**
- **Type**: API Key
- **Header Name**: `api-token`
- **Header Value Format**: `{api_token}`
- **Environment Variable**: `LETSCLOUD_API_TOKEN`

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"Authentication failed"**
- **Private GPT**: Check if your API key is correctly configured in the GPT settings
- **Public GPT**: Check if your API key is correct and provided without any prefix
- Try regenerating your API key in your LetsCould dashboard

**"No servers found"**
- Verify your account has active servers
- Check if your API key has the correct permissions
- Ensure your servers are not in a suspended state

**"Error talking to connector"**
- Verify your internet connection
- Check if the LetsCould API is accessible
- Try again in a few minutes

**"GPT not responding to commands"**
- **Private GPT**: Ensure your API key is properly configured in the GPT settings
- **Public GPT**: Make sure you've provided your API key in the conversation
- Try restarting the conversation

### **Recommended Solution**

For the best experience and to avoid most issues, **use the private version** of this GPT:
1. Follow the [GPT Duplication Guide](GPT_DUPLICATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Configure your API key once in the private GPT settings
3. Enjoy hassle-free infrastructure management
