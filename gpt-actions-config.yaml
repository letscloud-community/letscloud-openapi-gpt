# Error Handling

    backoff_multiplier: 2
    initial_delay: 1
  
  common_errors:
    - code: "UNAUTHORIZED"

      solution: "Verify the resource ID exists"
    
    - code: "VALIDATION_ERROR"
      description: "Invalid request parameters"
      solution: "Check required parameters and data types"

# Security Considerations
security:
  - "API keys should be stored securely and not exposed in logs"
  - "Use HTTPS for all API communications"
  - "Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information"
  - "Consider implementing rate limiting on the client side"

# Best Practices
best_practices:
  - "Always validate server IDs before performing operations"
  - "Use descriptive labels for servers and snapshots"
  - "Implement proper backup strategies using snapshots"
  - "Monitor server status before performing state-changing operations"
  - "Keep SSH keys organized with meaningful titles"
